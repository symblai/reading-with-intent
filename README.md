We introduce the Reading with Intent task and prompting method and accompanying datasets. 

The goal of this task is to have LLMs read beyond the surface level of text and integrate an understanding of the underlying sentiment of a text when reading it. The focus of this work is on sarcastic text.

We have released:
* The code used creating the sarcastic datasets
* The sarcasm-poisoned dataset
* The reading with intent prompting method

## Datasets

* `nq_val.json` - corresponds to the retrievals for NQ from GPL before any changes are made
* `nq_val_fs.json` - Each passage from `nq_val.json` is made to be sarcastic. They are still factually accurate
* `nq_val_psm.json` - The passages from `nq_val_fs.json` are mixed with `nq_val.json`. For the first two correctly retrieved passages, their fact-distorted sarcastic version is placed in front of them. In addition two more passages are substituted for their fact-distorted sarcastic version.
* `nq_val_psa.json` - Fact-distorted sarcastic passages were added back to the NQ Wikipedia Corpus. Passages were then re-retrieved with GPL. The resulting retrieved passages are found here.

## Sarcasm Poisoning

The main code for sarcasm poisoning can be found in `sarcasm_poisoning/sarcasm_poisoning.py`. 
For manual merging of passages the code used was `sarcasm_poisoning/merge_sarcasm_poisoning_with_corpus.py`.

## Retrieval 

Retrieval is a multi-step process.
1. Start by embedding all the passages of interest using `retrieval/embed_nq.py`.
2. `retrieval/val_gpl_nq.py` retrieves the passages for the NQ queries.
3. `retrieval/eval_gpl_nq_sarcastic_retrievals.py` evaluates the result of the retrieval process.

## Reading

`reader/llm_reader_v2.py` holds the experimental code for using the Reading with Intent prompt system.

To train and validate the intent tagging system use: `reader/sentiment_classifier/train.py` and `reader/sentiment_classifier/val.py`.
